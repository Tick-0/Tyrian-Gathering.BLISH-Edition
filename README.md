# The Tyrian Gathering Marker Project

## What is it?
The Tyrian Gathering Marker Project is a collection of TacO markers denoting every gathering node on each map in Tyria. While gathering nodes have variable spawn points, there are a set number of them. Having all node spawn points marked off helps farmers know specifically where to check for the materials they're looking for, without wasting time running around a region wondering if they've found every node.

## How do I use it?
To use this marker pac with BlishHUD you only need the .taco file in this repository. Simply paste said file into the markers folder for the Pathing module in BlishHUD

## Files
Everything except the .taco file is not needed and is simply there for the sake of transparacy.
