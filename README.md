# The Tyrian Gathering Marker Project

## What is it?
The Tyrian Gathering Marker Project is a collection of TacO markers denoting every gathering node on each map in Tyria. While gathering nodes have variable spawn points, there are a set number of them. Having all node spawn points marked off helps farmers know specifically where to check for the materials they're looking for, without wasting time running around a region wondering if they've found every node.

## How do I use it?
You can download the source right from here, zip the files, and change the extension to .taco, and drop the archive in the POIs folder of your TacO installation. (It's very important that the files are at the top level of the archive, just downloading the zip from GitHub won't work as they're nested down another folder.) Alternatively you can unzip the files, drop the TGMP xml files into your POIs folder and the contents of the Data folder into POIs/Data.

## Which maps are done and how do I know which ones they are?
I've set up a project showing the relative status of all Central Tyria maps and how much coverage they've gotten. As nodes change from day to day/map instance to map instance, it may take some time to aggregate them all. Also, Tyria is huge!

Please note that I've set the markers to disappear when you press your interaction key on the node. You must set this key in TacO for this feature to work unless you have it set to the default (F). The markers will reappear after 1 hour, which I've been told is the default respawn time of a normal node.

## What is TacO anyway?
TacO is an awesome overlay for Guild Wars 2, built by BoyC.2653. For more information about TacO, check out [it's website](http://www.gw2taco.com/)
